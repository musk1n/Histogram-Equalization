# HISTOGRAM EQUALIZATION

Histogram equalization is an image processing technique meant to enhance the
 contrast of an image by redistributing its intensity values. The pixel values are
 adjusted according to the histogram of the image in this process with the intention of
 uniform distribution of intensity, and therefore, enhancement of image details. By
 using the full dynamic range, histogram equalization allows for a better use of intensity
 levels, which is most advantageous for low-light or highly contrasted images.
